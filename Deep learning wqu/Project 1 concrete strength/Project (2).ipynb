    "Now that we understand the gradient descent update rule, it’s time to build a complete training loop and put all the moving parts together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where learning *actually happens*.  \n",
    "Our model starts with random weights and bias, and this loop will gradually adjust them to **minimize the loss** using the gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Does a Training Loop Do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In every training **epoch** (iteration), we perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward pass** – Compute predictions: $\\hat{y} = XW + b$  \n",
    "2. **Loss computation** – Measure how far off the predictions are  \n",
    "3. **Backward pass** – Compute gradients via `.backward()`  \n",
    "4. **Parameter update** – Adjust `W` and `b` using gradient descent  \n",
    "5. **Gradient reset** – Clear old gradients before the next epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code block to be implemented later:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "for epoch in range(epochs):\n",
    "    # 1. Predict\n",
    "    y_pred = predict(X_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Compute loss\n",
    "    loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. Backpropagation\n",
    "    loss.backward()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 4. Update weights\n",
    "    with torch.no_grad():\n",
    "        W -= learning_rate * W.grad\n",
    "        b -= learning_rate * b.grad\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 5. Reset gradients\n",
    "    W.grad.zero_()\n",
    "    b.grad.zero_()\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### **Why Use `torch.no_grad()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "When updating `W` and `b`, we **don’t want PyTorch to track** these operations in the computation graph.  \n",
    "Wrapping the update step in `torch.no_grad()` disables gradient tracking inside that block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Reset Gradients?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, PyTorch **accumulates gradients** after each `.backward()` call.  \n",
    "So we must **reset them manually** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "W.grad.zero_()\n",
    "b.grad.zero_()\n",
    "```\n",
    "❗ If we don’t clear the gradients, PyTorch will add new gradients on top of the old ones, leading to incorrect updates during training.\n",
    "\n",
